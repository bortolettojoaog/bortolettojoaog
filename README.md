## Hi! My name is JoÃ£o Guilherme Bortoletto.

> âœ¨ Iâ€™m interested in technology since I was 7 or 8 years old, when, out of curiosity, I started programming and searching about how modifications (mod) for electronic games were developed. I have been studying this subject since and, currently, I work with analysis and systems development.
